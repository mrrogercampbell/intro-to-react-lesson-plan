# Thought Process behind the Assessment Questions
This question listed in the [`Assessment Questions`](https://github.com/rc1336/intro-to-react-lesson-plan/blob/master/README.md) section was composed with the intent of testing the student's comprehension of the entire lesson. Students must understand the main concepts of `props`, `state`, `functional`, and `class` components before moving on to any further lesson within React. In my experience, if students progress without these basic fundamentals they struggle throughout the entire unit of learning React. I added in the vocabulary words check so that the instructor can see where students have any misconceptions on key terms and then have the ability to correct them.




This lesson plan is design to be read along with the corresponding lesson. It run through each section and its corresponding subsection to give instructor a quick view on the information that they will be covering. I have broken the entire document up by specific headers which represents the following:
- H1 or #: Is the start of a main section of information; such as the start of the lesson, the table of content, and the instructor prep section
  - Example: `# Intro to React`
    - This delineates the name of the lesson
- H2 or ##: Is the start of a sub-section
  - Example: `Thinking in React`
    - This delineates the beginning of a section which will cover all initial concepts that should be covered before learning about react component, state, and props.
    - I write these section with the intention of the accompanying lesson to have a paragraph of text which explain general concepts which will be cover more in the `H3` sections.
- H3 or ###: Are actual sections of content which will explain the concepts in detail and or be a instructor demo, group activity, etc.
