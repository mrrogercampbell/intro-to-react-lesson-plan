This question listed in the `Assessment Questions` section was composed with the intent of testing the student's comprehension of the entire lesson. Students must understand the main concepts of `props`, `state`, `functional`, and `class` components before moving on to any further lesson within React. In my experience, if students progress without these basic fundamentals they struggle throughout the entire unit of learning React. I added in the vocabulary words check so that the instructor can see where students have any misconceptions on key terms and then have the ability to correct them.
