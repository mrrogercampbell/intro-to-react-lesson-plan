# How to Use This Lesson Plan
This lesson plan was design to be read along with the corresponding lesson repo. It gives instructors cliff notes on the information that they will be covered in each section of the lesson.

I have broken the entire document up by specific headers which represents the following:
- `H1 or #`: Is the start of a main section of information
- Such as the start of the lesson, the table of content, and the instructor prep section
  - Example: `# Intro to React`
    - This delineates the name of the entire lesson
- `H2 or ##`: Is the start of a sub-section
  - Example: `Thinking in React`
    - This delineates the beginning of a sub-section within the lesson.
    - Within the actual lesson a `H2` will always have a paragraph or two which cover initial concepts and talking points
    - These paragraphs will set the tone for the information that will be covered within the sub-section.
- `H3 or ###`: Is the content that explains the concepts in detail via instructor explanations, interactive demos, individual activities, group activity, and more.

# Thought Process behind the Assessment Questions
This question listed in the [Assessment Questions](https://github.com/rc1336/intro-to-react-lesson-plan/blob/master/README.md) section was composed with the intent of testing the student's comprehension of the entire lesson.

Students must understand the main concepts of `props`, `state`, `functional`, and `class` components before moving on to any further lesson within React. In my experience, if students progress without these basic fundamentals they struggle throughout the entire unit of learning React. I added in the vocabulary words check so that the instructor can see where students have any misconceptions on key terms and then have the ability to correct them.
