# Intro to React

## Prerequisites
* JavaScript Fundamentals:
* Understanding with OOP
* Basic Data Types

## Learning Objectives
- By the end of this lesson students should be able to:
    - Define what React is and why it is used
    - Explain what JSX is and how it is utilized within the context of a React project
    - Understand React concepts:
        - Rendering Elements with JSX
        - Purpose of a React Components
    - Build basic React Components that can:
        - Instantiate, render, manipulate, and pass state and props
    - Explain the difference between:
        - Props and State
        - Class and Function Components
    - Be able to define all words in the `Vocabulary` section below

## Vocabulary

- `Framework`
- `library`
- `Virtual DOM`
- `JSX`
- `Components`
- `Functional Components`
- `Class Components`
- `Props`
- `State`

## Lesson Outline:

### Thinking in React
This section introduces students to the basic principals of React and how to conceptualize utilizing it while designing and building applications. A key point to touch on here is encapsulation.

#### What is a framework?
Brief overview explaining:
- The difference between a `framework` and a `library`
- The fact that React is commonly misconceived as a `framework` when in fact it is a JavaScript `library`
#### DOM Manipulation in Vanilla JavaScript
- Quick review on DOM manipulation
- Talk about the complication you encounter when using DOM manipulation in vanilla JavaScript when dealing with an enterprise-size application

##### Vanilla JS DOM Manipulation Review - Cold Call || Breakout Groups
-  Starter code is provided within lesson repo
-  Call on a random student for each of the following prompts and have them provide you the code solution.
                OR
- Have students break into small groups (2-3 based off class size) and work through each prompt together

    1. A variable which stores a DOM selector for:
       -  The `h1` element with a class of `grab-me`
       -  The `button` element with an `id` of `click-me`
       -  Define a function that adds a `click event` to the `click-me` button which changes the `innerText` of the selected `h1` element.

Once they complete this explain to them how cumbersome this can become with dealing with a larger application such as Twitter, Facebook, etc.


#### The Virtual DOM
Something here

#### JSX
Something here

### Components
Brief overview

#### Functional Components
Something here

##### Your First Component - We Do
Walk students through writing out their first functional component. **Provide a prompt**

#### Class Components
Something here

##### Your Second Component - We Do
Walk students through writing out their first class component. **Provide a prompt**

#### Class vs Functional
A brief explanation of when to use which and the pain points associated with each.

##### Build Two Components - You Do
Have students create a functional and class component on their own. **Provide a prompt**

### Props and State
Brief overview

#### Props
Something here

#### State
Something here

##### How do you conceptualize props and state - Turn and Discuss
Have student turn to their neighbor and discuss the following amongst themselves for 10 mins:
    - How they conceptualize props and state
    - What is the difference between prompts and state
**Provide a few more here**
Once 10 mins have lapsed call on one group for each prompt and have them explain what they discussed in regards to it.

## Check for Understanding
This section is meant to provide multiple assessments that instructors can utilize to test and quantify student understand of the lesson.

Assessment Questions:
- Is React a `library` or a `framework`
- Have each student in their own words define the following vocabulary words:
    - `Framework`
    - `library`
    - `Virtual DOM`
    - `JSX`
    - `Components`
    - `Functional Components`
    - `Class Components`
    - `Props`
    - `State`

## Further Reading
- Be giving to students as further reading to help solidify lesson concepts and or allow advance student more material to learn from 

# Instructor Prep Section
This section provides instructors extra details on the break down of this lesson.

# Delivery Tips:

* Think about how long you're talking
* Move quicker sooner, slower later
* Cold Call more often
* Revisit LOs
* Defer questions when appropriate

## Legend:
- I Do - Instructor-led demos
    - Students should `not` code along
- We Do - Instructor-led demos
    - Students should code along
- You Do - Test for understanding
    - Students should complete on their own
    - They can ask for instructor assistance
- Cold Call - Instructor calls on a random student(s) to answer prompt(s)
- Turn and Discuss - Student-led dialogue
    - Have students turn to their neighbor(s) and discuss the provided prompts
    - If time permits:
        - Once time allotted has lapsed the instructor should call on each group and have a representative talk about what their group discussed
- Breakout Groups - Break students into small groups to work through provided prompts
    - Typically 10-15 min time blocks

## Prep Resources
This section is meant to provide instructor helpful links that will assist them in preparing to teach this lesson. It should contain any resources that Curriculum Engineers used to write the lesson.

# Lesson Plan - Review Notes
This section is meant to collect instructor feedback on the lesson and lesson plan. **Could perhaps provide a link to a google form which asked the below questions**
Survey Questions:
1. Are the learning objectives present and complete?
2. What is the ratio of talking vs. doing? (60/40, TT/ST-wg vs ST-sg / individual)
3. What is the level of engagement?
4. Are exercise plans present?
5. Any pitfalls with the exercises?
